      <h2>#1 One Piece</h2>
      <p class="review">
                One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched.
        But not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we?

        A long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age. 

        In the world of One Piece, there is such a thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water.

        And where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates.

        Now how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple.

        One Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be. 

        One Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama/Friends that glues the whole crew together.
        <br>
          Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable.

        In contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does.

        Another potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is.

        Do not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit.

        In short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen.

        Regardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that. Most of the time that's all you need.

      <h2>#2 Naruto Shippuden</h2>
      <p class="review">
        I am a big anime fan and I have to say that Naruto: Shippuuden is one of my absolute all time favourites. There are probably so many people that would disagree with me and tell me that Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden are a waste of time and that the story is a bunch of fillers put together. I strongly disagree and will tell you all why with this review of mine. 

        First of all, the biggest difference between Naruto and Shippuuden is the darker tone, the maturity and the depth in Shippuuden. In Naruto, the whole series was about him wanting to become the Hokage, being clumsy and always working hard to become better than Sasuke. 

        I loved Naruto's dorkiness but in Shippuuden he becomes serious. The series as well. Now the friendship and loyalty takes over. The mysteries get their answers and new questions take form. 

        Akatsuki, the moon plan, Madara, war... the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, the cliffhangers... these things are what makes Shippuuden one of the best animes I know. Kishimoto has built this massive foundation for us to walk on during the first half, and now he slowly digs into the core of the story. It keeps you on the tip of your toes. That's why the story itself gets a 10/10 from me. Story (10/10)

        Of course the art is much better than Naruto. Shippuuden has much more attention for details, the characters' outfits are much better made, the colouring and effects are so much better animated. The landscapes are beautifully drawn. Fighting scenes and emotional scenes are something I've noticed myself are paid much more attention to. The characters movements flows better.The realistic feeling is all over Shippuuden. Great! Art (9/10) 

        To be honest, I prefer not to notice the sound at all. Sound in movies and series shouldn't be noticed. The music is there to strenghten the mood. And since I don't notice the sound and it makes me feel what I'm supposed to feel, I guess the sound is well picked. I really liked the piano pieces in Naruo. Grief and Sorrow is an extraordinary piece. But I especially enjoyed the Pain soundtrack with the choirs and dark pipe organs in Shippuuden. Sound (8/10) 

        In Naruto and Shippuuden, Kishimoto is very focused in telling all characters stories. All characters have their backgounds and special personality. They all feel like real people that you know and they all grow throughout the series. You follow their Changes and that's what is so great and important about a series that is this long. The character development. (10/10)

        So, to justify and defend Shippuuden... 
        First of all, you have to understand the use of fillers. With an anime this long the writer can't keep up with the pace. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of the manga. When the anime has reached too far, they have to buy time for the writer to write more. Or, they could make it like many other animes... Make up another story and end for it or just pause it for a couple of years while Kishi draws the manga like crazy. But that wouldn't make anyone happy. Please, stop going on and on about the fillers. They are there for a very good reason. 

        Naruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wishes to become the Hokage, to a serious, hardworking, loyal friend who doesn't only want to save his friend, but also the whole ninja world from the neverending cycle of hate and despair. I enjoy the series extremely much and I hope that you do too. ^^

      <h2>#3 Sword Art Online</h2>
      <p class="review">
        when I watched Alicization while it was airing, after each episodes I asked myself several questions......
        is this really SAO?
        Is Alicization the Arc where Kawahara Reki finally makes SAO good?
        before I watch Alicization I didn't like SAO ( only the movie was great ) , but after I watched Alicization I really can't believe the improve of this series. 
        <br>
        I will mention the general points that made me feel the evolution of Sword Art Online Alicization:

        ((Warning: a major spoilers below))
        <br>
        1- Story:
        it is much better than previous seasons, first reason because of the sequence of events and the mystery that we are not used to previously. Second reason is that because Alicization take the concept which Aincrad arc should have been taken. The main reason why I will defend Alicization because I belive that sao had a cool concept, it is basically a boss rush anime, they have to climb 100 floors in every episode and taken them to a new boss, it is a really cool concept for isekai because it took the general idea of ​​the virtual world and the programmed characters where they live as humans and they have their own world, their own laws and their own history.
        <br>
        2- Explain the construction of the virtual world and its details:
        you must know that the anime doesn't need to have sword fights in every episode, these characters have lives and they're living them, because they must explain the details of the world and the goals of the characters, because there is no point in fighting without explaining the story and events.
        <br>
        3- The great antagonist of this season:
        to be fair, Quinella is the most compelling and fearsome antagonist that SAO has ever had. she's one of the only antagonists within the series (without including eiji from the movie) that I like for her motivations and true plans. she is the only main villain in SAO light novel series who had her backstory told in great detail, rather than being presented as just a generic villain with a stupid reasons and no backstory. Quinella is Leader of the Human Empire in Underworld and the Highest Minister of Axiom Church and her goals is Gain full control over the Underworld and rule it as its Goddess and gain full control over the Cardinal System. 
        <br>
        4- Animation and art:
        like previous seasons the art is incredible, but Alicization is the best looking anime from this series, the artwork is overall gorgeous.. The animation is great, it is reminded me of ufotable style.
        <br>
        5- Sound:
        again like previous seasons the music is incredible. Yuki Kajiura is one of the biggest names in anime music, and her music is outstanding. The new music like Eugeo's theme and Alice's theme and and another many ones are extremely amazing. All of openings and endings are extremely awesome and the second opening ( Resister ) by Asca has became my best opening I have ever heard.
        <br>
        6- Characters: 
        two new main characters are now introduced: Eugeo & Alice I really like the friendship between kirito and Eugeo. The new characters like Eugeo , Alice , and Bercouli are much better than the most characters in the pervious seasons. Even Kirito I think he became much better in this season and he show his personality and finally we know a lot of things about his past and I really like him in this season.
        <br>
        7- Kirito has been considerably nerfed:
        in this third season, we get to see a more vulnerable Kirito, he can still feel pain, and thus fear and death. In episode 4 he was almost killed by the goblin if not for Eugeo’s intervention. And during that moment, we can see Kirito’s fearful emotion, something which we don’t often see in previous seasons.
        <br>
        8- The deuteragonist of the season:
        Eugeo the new character is an interesting character, it is the first time for other characters to shine rather than only Kirito himself. Eugeo proves himself to be the best deuteragonist in SAO Universe, while Kirito can show more of his personality with him and have better opportunity to develop. Alicization Arc has managed to show much better character development, something which was completely missing from the previous two seasons.
        <br>
        Overall: 7.5 / 10
        I really loved this season. I just recommend giving this season a chance even if you like me did not enjoy SAO previous seasons.

      <h2>#4 My Hero Academia</h2>
      <p class="review">
        *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*
          <br>
          Inspired by American superhero comics, Horikoshi Kouhei's Boku no Hero Academia (or 'My Hero Academia' in English) manga started publishing two years ago, but got gained a lot of popularity only after the release of One Punch Man anime. But being honest here, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed by it.
          <br>
          Story: 6/10
          The story is rather childish. In the world of My Hero Academia, on one fine day, out of nowhere, new born babies started having some random super powers which are called 'quirks'. With that, evil villains emerged, and with that heroes emerged too, which soon became usual and was accepted by the society. Our main protagonist of the show, Izuku Midoriya, who is always bullied by his childhood friend Bakugou Katsuki who has a great quirk, wanted to join the prestigious 'Hero School', UA, and become the best hero in the world like 'All Might'. But he discovered in his childhood that he is 'quirkless', but finding the potential in him due to various situations, All Might passes on his quirk to him which is somewhat like ultimate strength, speed and endurance. But due to his weak body and lack of practice, he always hurts his body due to the recoil. Anyway, he manages to clear the UA entrance exam and now he must struggle in the school to pass out as a pro hero.
          Okay, so far so good. But from this point, the excitement goes downhill. Bad jokes, predictable events, childish plot, and what not, makes it seem more like an American Cartoon than a Japanese Anime.
          <br>
          Art: 7/10
          Bones Studio, very popular for it's work in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, delivers some of the best artworks out there. But this time, it gambled with My Hero Academia. The graphics are very sketchy and it feels like we are reading a comic book. It may be a hit for some people. But honestly speaking, it was a miss for me.
          <br>
          Sound: 9/10
          There is no doubt that Porno Graffitti, the most misunderstood band name, did an amazing job for the OP with the song 'The Day'. The fast and catchy song and the visuals along with it are very good and fits the mood. 'Heroes' by Brian the Sun is another great ED. And guess what? Kaji Yuki performed the role of Todoroki Shouto! Also other talented voice actors like Okamoto Nobuhiko, Suwabe Junichi, Kitamura Eri, Yuuki Aoi, Inoue Marina did a great job. The OSTs during the action scenes are really good too. 
          <br>
          Character: 6/10
          This is the biggest negative point for the show. The characters, are well, lame. Everyone is either silly or one dimensional or simply annoying. They all have unique quirks which make them different from each other. But still, they are lame.
          Bakugou Katsuki is the lamest and the most annoying of all the characters. He exists just to bully Midoriya Izuku to make the anime more shounenish. 
          Midoriya Izuku is no good either. A lame-ass who usually cries over stupid things instead of fighting like a man. He is a fan boy who cries tears of happiness like a girl when he is able to see some pro hero. That's seriously lame. 
          All Might, the strongest hero in the world is the silliest childhood-hero like character. He has got some weird hairstyle and dialogues without any punch. He has one alternate form in which he shrinks to a thinner size with a gunny un-proportional face and body, which may have been shown for comedy, but I found it silly. 
          Eraser Head is the only character whom I found interesting and mature. Reminded me of Kakashi Hatake from Naruto. :P
          <br>
          Enjoyment: 8/10
          I enjoyed the show only in some parts of it (mostly the action part). The rest of the show was silly, childish, predictable and it felt like it was targeted for pre-teens. But anyway, if you have already watched a lot of good anime, then this anime is suited for casual watching.
          <br>
          Overall: 7.2/10
          If you are a pre-teen or younger, you will like or maybe love this show. It has all the scenes and factors which today's generation kids love (I guess). If you are a matured adult who is not into silly comedy, bullied-kid-turned-into-superhero or someone who finds funny villains evil, you should probably avoid this anime.

      <h2>#5 Demone Slayer</h2>
      <p class="review">
        This is your typical Shounen anime but done damn right.

        The story is somewhat new in a sense and character location or setting I would say is also kind of new to me in shounen anime, I am saying this because now days shounen anime always start in a city or suburb areas. Its nice to see this anime start the story from middle of nowhere kind of setting (given this anime takes place in past, its not new but different in my opinion).

        The action scenes are jaw dropping and are something you would rewind the few seconds of that scene to see again. Tanijro as a character is also breath of fresh air in this shounen setting, because he do not have lofty goals like becoming king of pirates or something like that, he just wants to turn his sister back to human form once again and he do not rely on friendship power or activating his fourth gear on or going ssj 3, nope he trains like any other human being to earn his power. Directing on this anime is also fascinating, you can tell that director cut no corner for fight scenes(like one other anime I know, looking at you OPM S2) and he went with full force to animate those gorgeous fight scenes. 

        The only tiny bit problem is that occasional use of CG models of characters when they are far in the view or are fast moving, but this use of CG is ten times better than what we got for goblin slayer. When its comes to using CG studio Ufotable is leagues ahead in the competition and it shows here. 

        This is only anime I am enjoying, which is doing action scenes right. Give it a try you will enjoy it.
